##Introduction
The Virtual Classroom Project is a web application designed to help instructors manage virtual classes and allow students to join, access course materials, and participate in discussions on lectures. It is a full-stack project that includes both backend and frontend components.

##Features
Class Management: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete classes, units (Books), and sessions (Chapters).
Lecture Access: Students can access materials for each lecture within a session.
Discussions: Students can add nested comments on lectures to engage in discussions.
Enrollment Control: Only enrolled students are allowed to join and participate in classes.
Authentication: Basic authentication is implemented to manage user roles (admin/instructor/student).

##Technologies Used
Backend:
Java 17 and Spring Boot
MySQL for data storage
JPA/Hibernate for database interaction
Spring Security for authentication and authorization
Frontend:
React for building the user interface
Axios for making HTTP requests
React Router for navigation

##Architecture
The project is divided into two main parts:

###Backend: REST API built with Spring Boot that handles business logic, data persistence, and user management.
###Frontend: React app that interacts with the backend API, allowing users to navigate between pages and perform actions such as enrolling in classes or commenting on lectures.

##Setup Instructions
###Prerequisites
Java 17
Node.js and npm
MySQL
Maven
###1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-classroom.git
cd virtual-classroom

##Backend: Spring Boot Configuration
###1. Set Up MySQL Database
Create a database named virtual_classroom in MySQL.
In src/main/resources/application.properties, update your MySQL database credentials:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/virtual_classroom
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
###2. Run the Spring Boot Application
Navigate to the backend directory and run the application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Backend will run at http://localhost:8080.

##Frontend: React Setup
###1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
###2. Start the React Application
Run the following command to start the React app:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

##Running the Application
Start the Backend: Run the Spring Boot application as described in the backend setup.
Start the Frontend: Run the React app using npm start.
Access the Application:
####Frontend: http://localhost:3000
####Backend API: http://localhost:8080

##Future Enhancements
JWT Authentication: Upgrade authentication to use JWT tokens for improved security.
Real-Time Notifications: Implement real-time notifications for discussions and updates.
File Upload: Add the ability for instructors to upload files such as PDFs, videos, and other learning materials.
Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin dashboard for better class and user management.
